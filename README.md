# Student Porfolio Archive

This repository is meant to keep samples of portfolios that achieve the level we expect from graduating students. This will help us better measure and maintain our teaching standards over time.

We want to keep those portfolios which confidently meet our expectations (maybe with some flourish) but keep in mind that this repository is **not** for exceptional portfolio projects. We want to keep those which we are referring as tech-skill "4" students so as to compare later our own grading.
